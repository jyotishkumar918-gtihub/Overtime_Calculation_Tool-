Overtime Calculation Tool (Excel Automation)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **automated Excel solution** for calculating and tracking analysts’ overtime (OT) eligibility and achievements.  
The tool works seamlessly with a **Pivot Table refresh**, and automatically determines who qualifies for overtime based on predefined business rules.  

Overtime is considered **only on weekends**, and the tool ensures fair and accurate tracking of both **eligibility** and **achievement**.
